        <h5 id="WorkHeading">Work Experience</h5>
            <br>
            <p id="Work">When I was in grade 10 going to grade 11, I worked in a bicycle repair shop. Here I learned the value of customer care and caring for what matters to them. After I finished school in 2018 at DF Malan High School, I decided to started working. The very next year 2019 I work my first fulltime job as a technician in an RND Company.  Here I learned the value of money and how hard it is to get money. For about 4-6 Months I worked out in the field, but my attention started dwelling more to the software side of the business. This company develops security solutions for estates and mines. Soon after the change of focus I became a manager/COO of the company. My job is to make sure that everybody knows what they have to do and to make sure that they do just that. For me to do this well means I need to understand all the parts of a project, software and hardware. On the down time I create small applications for the company and for myself to keep my mind challenged.</p>
